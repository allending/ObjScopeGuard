# ObjScopeGuard #

Purpose:
Tiny library intended for adding scope guard support to Objective-C projects.
A scope guard is a block of code that is run when the guard goes out of scope.

This functionality is useful for cleanly specifying resource cleanup, code
that needs to be executed, logging, etc. in a more declarative manner.

Requirements:
- Xcode 4.3+
- Clang compiler
- Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) enabled

Example:
- (void)doComplicatedStuffWithCoreData {
    [self.managedObjectContent lock];
     ON_SCOPE_EXIT(^{
         // Unlock the context no matter how we return from method
         [self.managedObjectContext unlock];
     });
     // do complicated stuff with many return points
}

Usage:
- You need ADScopeGuard.h and ADScopeGuard.m present in your project, either as source
or as some form of library.
- MAKE_GUARD(void_block) and ON_SCOPE_EXIT(void_block) are used to create scope guards.
The void_block parameter is well ... a void block.
Notes:
- If Objective-C++ is being used, use Boost ScopeExit or something else instead.
